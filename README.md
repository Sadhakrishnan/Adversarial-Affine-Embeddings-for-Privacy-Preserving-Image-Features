# Adversarial-Affine-Embeddings-for-Privacy-Preserving-Image-Features
This repository implements a privacy-preserving feature representation by lifting descriptors to affine subspaces with adversarial samples. It enables secure and efficient feature matching for tasks like visual localization, 3D mapping, and face authentication.
